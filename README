pmDoctrineGeneratorPlugin
=======================

The `pmDoctrineGeneratorPlugin` decouples the admin generator and the forms
framework by delegating the module behavior to the form. Also, adds to the
admin module the show action.

Installation
------------

  * Install the plugin

        [bash]
        $ ./symfony plugin:install pmDoctrineGeneratorPlugin

  * Clear the cache

        [bash]
        $ ./symfony cc

Configuration
-------------

  * Set the pmDoctrineGenerator class on generator.yml

        [yml]
        generator:
          class: pmDoctrineGenerator
          # ...

  * And the basic theme

        [yml]
        generator:
          # ...
          param:
            # ...
            theme: basic
            # ...

  * Configure the module as you configure the standard admin generator except
    that fields configuration and display are no longer available on new, edit,
    and show contexts.

Features
--------

  * fieldset support by adding the `getFieldsets` method in the form

        [php]
        class Person extends sfFormDoctrine
        {
          // ...

          public function getFieldsets()
          {
            return array(
              'NONE' => array('first_name', 'last_name'),
              'Address' => array('street', 'number', 'city_id')
            );
          }

  * layout support by adding the `getLayout` method in the form

        [php]
        class Person extends sfFormDoctrine
        {
          // ...

          public function getLayout()
          {
            return 'tabbed'; // or 'folded'
          }

      Also you could create another layouts, creating a partial. I.E., tabbed
      layout is coded in _form_tabbed.php and _show_form_tabbed.php.

  * fields and display configuration through the form.
  * the forms are displayed in tables rather than divs (as originally in forms)
    and thus the partials are less than in the standard generator.
  * form formatters are used if defined.
  * object actions can be forbidden if a method is defined in the object. IE:

          [php]
          class Person extends BasePerson
          {
            /**
             * this method will be used to forbid the edit action in the generator
             */
            public function canEdit()
            {
              return !$this->getLock();
            }
          }

  * object actions can be shown on a condition. IE:

          [yml]
          list:
            object_actions:
              _edit:
                show_when: canEdit
              # ...
